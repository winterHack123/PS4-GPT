Pakistan kept their interest alive with a DRS-manufactured win over New Zealand in Bengaluru while Australia ended England's tournament with a convincing victory. Two semi-final spots sealed, Australia have the 3rd spot in their grasp and there is a big queue as at least 3, 4 or even 5 teams fight it out for the 4th and the last place. Two teams have their eliminations confirmed and one of them turned out to be the defending champions. A big Sunday afternoon game coming up tomorrow - India and South Africa are already through, but there is still a chance for either team to finish 1st on the table. Do join us for all the action. For now, cheers and bye..\nPat Cummins - It's been great, the boys played brilliantly, we're getting better with each match. We've improved with each game, still not playing the perfect game. It's something we pride ourselves on, we didn't start well, but the boys have put their hands up, ever since the first 2 games. He has been bowling beautifully in the last 3 games (on Zampa), made 29 and took a banger (of a catch). We thought it was a good wicket and would probably break up to his strength. Maxi and Mitchy will be back, they have had a great tournament and for the others to come in and put in a performance was nice. It wasn't too bad tonight (on the dew), sometimes we do see players getting wet as they slide on, but it wasn't that bad today.\nJos Buttler - Disappointment, we were having the same chat after the match. Improvements today, more with the bat, but we were still well short, no complaints if you lose by 30 runs. A low point as a captain, you stand in this position, you came to India with high hopes and expectations, we haven't done ourselves any justice, everyone knows how much hard work we've put, these losses weigh high on our shoulders. We did well (with the ball), but we could have done better, we let them put up frustrating little partnerships. With the dew around, we backed ourselves and we fell 30 runs short. It was the right shot to play (on his dismissals), the execution wasn't great, I was trying to take it back to them. I haven't played as well as I can, in such a pivotal position, I think I let myself and my team down. Only way to come back is to put in the hard yards at the nets and come back better in the next game.\nStats courtesy Deepu Narayanan\nMost consecutive defeats for a Full member side in WCs \\n11 Afghanistan (2019-23) \\n7 Sri Lanka (1983-87) \\n6 Bangladesh (2023) * \\n5 West Indies (2019) \\n5 England (2023) *\nMost defeats for a Full member side in a World Cup \\n9 Afghanistan (2019) \\n6 Sri Lanka (1987) \\n6 Bangladesh (2007) \\n6 West Indies (2019) \\n6 Bangladesh (2023) \\n6 England (2023)\nMitchell Starc: Keeps the momentum going. Not the best start but we have progressed nicely. We are going along nicely. They would probably claim a moral victory (smiles). They are the defending champions, we thought they will come aggressively at us. Was generally slow to start with. We didn\u2019t really mention a par score. Zampa took the momentum away. A couple of wickets in the powerplay helped. Zampa has had a helluva a day. Probably didn\u2019t get it right the other night against NZ. Got a proper training session in. Sometimes my take-off into the delivery stride forced me to jump into it. The one to Joe Root swung a little late. I certainly heard it. Marnus heard it but he has a poor strike rate when it comes to reviews, gets it right once in 50 (laughs). I don\u2019t think you can take anyone lightly. There is some nip in Wankhede. We saw India bowling superbly the other night.\nAdam Zampa | Man of the Match: I mean just summing up the conditions was important. We batted really well to get to 286. The ground got really dewy. Attacking the stumps was important. It came out as good as it ever has. Felt really good. Just tried to be really positive and bat out the 50 overs. Was important to rotate the strike. One of those days. Felt satisfying. Hopefully my best is yet to come.\n22:17 Local Time, 16:47 GMT, 22:17 IST:  They came in as the defending champions, were trounced in the first game at Ahmedabad and it was only apt that it was at this very venue that they've been officially knocked out of the tournament. Their batting had been a shocker right through, they did improve on that front, but 286 was a bridge too far. Lost two early wickets, Malan and Stokes steadied things with a partnership, but they once again lost two wickets on the bounce. It was followed by another partnership, but was followed by quick wickets which derailed the chase completely. Rashid, Willey and Woakes did try and pull off something special, but they were always going to struggle to get to the winning line. A superb night for Adam Zampa, 3 for 21 with the ball, a handy 29 with the bat and a special catch to cap the day off. Australia now have 10 points and move ahead of New Zealand in the table, with games against Afghanistan and Bangladesh to come, they'll fancy booking a spot in the semis. England have something to play for though, they lie 10th in the table and need to win their last 2 matches if they're to qualify for the 2025 Champions Trophy.\nHazlewood to Adil Rashid, out Caught by Josh Inglis!! England have been knocked out of #CWC23. The defending champions have been dumped out by their traditional foes on a balmy Ahmedabad night. Banged in short and at the stumps, Rashid backed away on the swat, gets a massive top-edge, high up in the air, Josh Inglis calls for the catch and takes it calmly. Adil Rashid c Josh Inglis b Hazlewood 20(15) [4s-1 6s-1]\n Hazlewood to Adil Rashid, THATS OUT!! Caught!! \nJosh Hazlewood [9.0-1-49-1] is back into the attack\nMark Wood, right handed bat, comes to the crease\nStoinis to Woakes, out Caught by Labuschagne!! That could be the game for England - a low full-toss and Woakes was on his knee as he looked to pump it out of the ground, gets down onto his knee and swings hard, gets a decent enough connection, but the boundaries are big and Labuschagne has enough time to run around to his left from deep mid-wicket, slides and completes the catch. Woakes c Labuschagne b Stoinis 32(33) [4s-4 6s-1]\n Stoinis to Woakes, THATS OUT!! Caught!! \n Stoinis to Woakes, no run, slower short ball outside off - no pace to work with, Woakes nearly swung himself around as he threw the bat and missed \n Stoinis to Adil Rashid, 1 run, fuller length delivery on the pads, whipped away in front of square on the on-side for a single \nStoinis to Adil Rashid, SIX, a high full-toss, a wild swing, a huge top-edge and it's a six over third man, England just about staying alive, it's deemed as a fair delivery - Stoinis tried following Rashid as he backed away, the ball slipped out of his grasp and it's a high full-toss - Rashid swung hard, the ball caught a fat top-edge and sailed over the keeper's head\n Stoinis to Woakes, 1 run, another near perfect yorker from Stoinis, dug out to long-on and it's only a single \n Stoinis to Woakes, 2 runs, a leg-stump yorker from Stoinis, flicked behind square on the on-side and Woakes rushes back for the second \n"}
